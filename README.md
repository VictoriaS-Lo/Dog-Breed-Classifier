# Dog-Breed-Classifier

This ongoing project is a machine learning model that classifies dog images into one of four specific breeds: "german shepherd", "poodle", "golden retriever", "samoyed" or a fifth category labeled "Other." The model leverages deep learning techniques and transfer learning to achieve accurate results, with a focus on real-world applications such as pet identification or shelter assistance.


### Key Features:
- Classifies images between four predefined dog breeds and an "Other" category.
- Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with transfer learning (InceptionV3).
- Handles the added challenge of training with a small dataset.
